# CRUD-Docker

## Employee Management App

A simple Employee Management app using Spring Boot (BE), Angular (FE), and MySQL. Perform CRUD operations with three basic pages: list all employees, create a new employee, and view employee details. The whole app was then "dockerized" with three Dockerfiles for BE, FE, and DB and a docker-compose file to run the images effortlessly
